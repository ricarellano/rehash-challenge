# Contexts

This directory is here in case you'd like to set up context(s) to manage chat or chat list state. You can use redux, context, or neither during the challenge. Up to you!

We aren't providing boilerplate because there are a bunch of different context patterns and we don't know which you prefer.

Hint: You'll want to add your context Provider to `_app.js` above the `<Component />` component in the render tree.
